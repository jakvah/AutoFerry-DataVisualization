# AutoFerry-DataVisualization
This project aims at visualizing data from the MilliAmpere autoferry, for a control center. As the autoferry currently is not operational, a Unity-based simulator is used to simulate the behaviour of the ferry. This repo contains source code for extrating, saving and visualizing data from the Unity simulator.
